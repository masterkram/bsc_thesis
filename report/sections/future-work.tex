A core issue with this problem is data imbalance. There is data imbalance at two levels
first of all at the radar image level, frequencies for pixels containing rain are much lower than the opposite.
Secondly at the dataset level, the training, validation and test datasets contain different amounts of rain
which may bias the scores a model obtains. We should create

which should be properly not only rain is much less frequent than no rain but
there can be biases between the overall amount of rain in the training, validation and testing datasets which may lead to
incorrect evaluations on how the models are performing.
