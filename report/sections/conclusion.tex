In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to create
a model to predict precipitation with only sequences radar inputs.
We found key aspects that need to be addressed in order to build a well performing model.
These aspects are a model architecture that supports a time dimension such as RNNs or 3D Unet.
Then a method to work with imbalanced data, weighting the loss function.
The methods that can be used to create this model, are shown to be ConvLSTM and 3D Unet based models 
although other methods may be valid but we have not tested them.
.
The model appears to not be very effective from a visual inspection
