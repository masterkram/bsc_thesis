In this research we focus on testing the hypothesis if a model trained on satellite sequences is capable of forecasting precipitation.
This is unclear as of now because most other studies rely on only radar or a combination of satellite and radar.
In the precipitation nowcasting field of research, there is a symbiosis between the task of video-to-video prediction and precipitation forecasting, models created for one are used in the other and vice-versa.
It is unclear whether these techniques can be successfully applied when using input and output data from different domains. We compare three different model architectures, UNet, ConvLSTM + Attention and ConvLSTM. All of these techniques are analyzed in both pixel-classification and pixel-regression implementations.
