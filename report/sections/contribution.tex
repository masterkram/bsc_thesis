In this research we focus on testing the hypothesis if a model trained on satellite sequences is capable of forecasting precipitation.
This is unclear as of now because most other studies rely on only radar or a combination of satellite and radar.
In the precipitation nowcasting field of research, there is a symbiosis between the task of video-to-video prediction, i.e predicting following frames after n previous frames and precipitation forecasting, models created for one are used in the other and vice-versa.
It is unclear whether these techniques can be successfully applied when using input and output data originating from different domains. We compare three different model architectures, 3D UNet, ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with Axial Attention. All of these techniques are analyzed in both pixel-classification and pixel-regression implementations.
