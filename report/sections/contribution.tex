In this research we focus on finding possible approaches
to forecast precipitation, given only satellite imagery.
We create 4 different models that are then trained for this task.
We then evaluate our models using a wide range of evaluation metrics.
%In the precipitation nowcasting field of research, there is a symbiosis between the task of video-to-video prediction, i.e predicting following frames after n previous frames and precipitation forecasting, models created for one are used in the other and vice-versa.
%It is unclear whether these techniques can be successfully applied when using input and output data originating from different domains. We compare three different model architectures, 3D UNet, ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with Axial Attention. All of these techniques are analyzed in both pixel-classification and pixel-regression implementations.ion
